## ML Algorithms

This project contains some basic implementations of common machine learning algorithms. The algorithms included are:

* Linear Regression
* Generalized Linear Models, including Gamma, Poisson, and Logistic regression (in progress)
* Support Vector Classifier
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* K-Means Clustering
* Gaussian Mixture Models
* Perceptron



Algorithms in the works:

* Tree Boosters (AdaBoost, GBM)
* MLP, and CNN, RNN, LSTM
* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Bayesian Linear Regression
* Regularized Regression (Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet)



Also in the works:

* Significant code cleanup and modularization
* More support for different loss and activation functions
* More use of `numpy` (especially matrix algebra functions) for performance improvements
